// Notice that our action object just contains the minimum amount of
// information needed to describe what happened. We know which post
// we need to update, and which reaction name was clicked on.
// We could have calculated the new reaction counter value and put
// that in the action, but it's always better to keep the action
// objects as small as possible, and do the state update calculations
// in the reducer. This also means that reducers can contain as much
// logic as necessary to calculate the new state.

// When using Immer, you can either "mutate" an existing state object,
// or return a new state value yourself, but not both at the same time.
// See the Immer docs guides on Pitfalls and Returning New Data for
// more details.
